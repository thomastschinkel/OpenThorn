-- The "Public can read deployments" policy let anyone (including anon) LIST every
-- object in the public `deployments` bucket via the storage API. Public object
-- downloads do not need a SELECT policy (the bucket is public), and the app only
-- uploads thumbnails + builds public URLs — it never lists the bucket. Replace the
-- broad policy with an owner/collaborator-scoped one so cross-user enumeration is
-- no longer possible.

drop policy if exists "Public can read deployments" on storage.objects;
