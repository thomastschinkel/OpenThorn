      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        OpenThorn is operated by <strong>Thomas T.</strong>, located in{' '}
        <strong>Italy</strong> (the "Data Controller"). For privacy-related enquiries,
        contact us at{' '}
        <strong><a href="mailto:mys.thomas00@gmail.com">mys.thomas00@gmail.com</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only what is necessary to provide the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account data</strong> — your email address when you register or sign in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project data</strong> — the prompts you write, the code OpenThorn
          generates, and your project names. Stored so you can return to your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical / error data</strong> — error reports that may include browser
          information, the page URL, and your user ID if you are signed in. Collected via
          Sentry to help us fix bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics data</strong> — page views and feature interactions. Collected
          via PostHog <em>only if you give consent</em> through the cookie banner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and project data</strong> — performance of a contract
          (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): processing is necessary to provide the service you signed
          up for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error monitoring</strong> — legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):
          we have a legitimate interest in maintaining a functioning, secure service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics</strong> — consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR): PostHog is only
          activated after you accept analytics via the cookie banner. You may withdraw
          consent at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>We use the following processors who handle personal data on our behalf:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Supabase, Inc.</strong> (authentication and database) — your account
          credentials and project data are stored on Supabase infrastructure. Data may be
          processed in the United States under Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sentry, Inc.</strong> (error monitoring) — error reports including
          technical context are sent to Sentry. Data may be processed in the United States
          under Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PostHog, Inc.</strong> (analytics) — page view and interaction data is
          sent to PostHog only if you accept analytics cookies. Data may be processed in
          the United States under Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>OpenThorn does not sell your personal data to any third party.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and project data</strong> — retained for as long as your account
          is active, or until you request deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error data</strong> — retained according to Sentry's configured retention
          period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics data</strong> — retained according to PostHog's retention
          settings. Withdrawing consent stops new data collection; historical data may
          remain until the retention period expires.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Supabase, Sentry, and PostHog are US-based companies. Transfers of personal data
        from the EU/EEA to these providers are covered by Standard Contractual Clauses
        (SCCs) approved by the European Commission under Art. 46 GDPR.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Under the GDPR you have the right to:</p>

        <li>
          <strong>Erasure</strong> — ask us to delete your account and associated data.
        </li>

          <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> — revoke analytics consent at any time via the
          cookie banner, without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.
