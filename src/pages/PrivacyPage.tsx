      <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        OpenThorn is operated by <strong>Thomas Tschinkel</strong>, located in{' '}
        <strong>Rome, Italy</strong> (the "Data Controller"). For privacy-related enquiries,
        contact us at{' '}
        <strong><a href="mailto:mys.thomas00@gmail.com">mys.thomas00@gmail.com</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only what is necessary to provide the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account data</strong> — your email address when you register or sign in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API keys</strong> — the API keys you add for third-party AI providers
          (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic). These are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
          and are never shared with third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project data</strong> — the prompts you write, the code OpenThorn
          generates, and your project names. Stored so you can return to your work.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and project data</strong> — performance of a contract
          (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): processing is necessary to provide the service you signed
          up for.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>We use the following processors who handle personal data on our behalf:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vercel Inc.</strong> (hosting and infrastructure) — the service is hosted
          on Vercel's platform. Request data including IP addresses may be processed by
          Vercel. Data may be processed in the United States under Standard Contractual
          Clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supabase, Inc.</strong> (authentication and database) — your account
          credentials and project data are stored on Supabase infrastructure. Data may be
          processed in the United States under Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>OpenThorn does not sell your personal data to any third party.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and project data</strong> — retained for as long as your account
          is active, or until you request deletion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Vercel and Supabase are US-based companies. Transfers of personal data from the
        EU/EEA are covered by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European
        Commission under Art. 46 GDPR.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Under the GDPR you have the right to:</p>

        <li><strong>Rectification</strong> — ask us to correct inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Erasure</strong> — ask us to delete your account and associated data.
        </li>
